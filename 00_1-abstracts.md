### Abstract



##### Global Problem (impact statement)

- biodiversity loss
- species decline
- islands most healily impacted
- nz has long history of removing and managing ecosystem-level problems e.g...



##### Causes

- predation by invasive mammals is one of the main causes of decline in native biota on islands
- In New Zealand, conservation actions are frequently aimed at reducing and eradicating invasive mammal species from offshore islands, mainland islands and conservation land. 
- While eradications have been successfully carried out on islands, a bold new focus for conservation management in New Zealand is aimed at eradicating widespread invasive mammals on the mainland. 
- An important lesson from island eradications, however, is that removal of single species can produce unexpected outcomes for other species.



##### How decisions are made to reduce impacts?

- Such unexpected outcomes are also likely to occur when attempting to remove widespread and well established pest mammal populations on mainland New Zealand. 
- Management to reverse the decline of native species through removal of invasive mammals needs to consider multiple threats, including possible additive, and synergistic effects of species interactions.
- IUCN red-list and such like, updated 5-years??
- And POPULATION MODELLING.....
- Not quick enough
- therefore PFNZ2050 is a waste of time...



#### In this thesis I show:

- how to build models of invasive mammal species interactions in New Zealand forests from the current understanding species dynamics (intro).
- and use these models in a bayesian framework understand how populations of interacting species will react under different conditions (case study beech model chapter two)
- These models can be extended to a SSM framework using the same Bayesian hierarchical methods and capture-recapture data from more complex studies (mixed (podocarp/hardwood) forests in New Zealand, chapter three). 
- Outputs from these models can then be used to produce community driven projects from the current  (and updated) scienfitic literature (chapter four). 
- An additional advantage of this framework allows for the continued use and development of the proposed models for future management.

*Population dynamics of interacting invasive species in New Zealand forests*

One of the main causes of decline in native biota on islands is predation by invasive mammals. In New Zealand, conservation actions are frequently aimed at reducing and eradicating invasive mammal species from offshore islands, mainland islands and conservation land. While eradications have been successfully carried out on islands, a bold new focus for conservation management in New Zealand is aimed at eradicating widespread invasive mammals on the mainland. 

An important lesson from island eradications, however, is that removal of single species can produce unexpected outcomes for other species. Such unexpected outcomes are also likely to occur when attempting to remove widespread and well established pest mammal populations on mainland New Zealand. Management to reverse the decline of native species through removal of invasive mammals needs to consider multiple threats, including possible additive, and synergistic effects of species interactions.

This thesis aims to build models of invasive mammal species interactions in New Zealand forests to understand how populations of interacting species will react under different conditions. These models will be parameterized using Bayesian hierarchical methods and capture-recapture data from studies in pure beech forest and mixed (podocarp/hardwood) forests in New Zealand. A third dataset will be used to link native species responses to changes in invasive mammal populations. 

Outputs from these models will provide information to understand trends in community structure before, during and after different control measures for managing invasive species. An additional advantage of this framework allows for the continued use and development of the proposed models for future management.
