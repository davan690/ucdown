Action required - Breach of enrolment conditions - Anthony Davidson (3164284) PhD (STC) - anthonydavidson101@gmail.com

To whom it concerns,

Thank you very much for this **formal warning** regarding my canditature. I will address this problem as soon as possible. You may notice that I have not paid my SSF AND my supervisor is not on campus until next week.

I would like to refer you to this [NATURE publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7) that was published on the 13th November 2019 (yesterday) repeating the 2017 graduate survey. In this issue the [editor](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1) also made the following statements:

"Anxiety and depression in graduate students is worsening. The health of the next generation of researchers needs systemic change to research cultures."

"The solution to this emerging crisis does not lie solely in institutions doing more to provide on-campus mental-health support and more training for supervisors — essential though such actions are. It also lies in recognizing that mental ill-health is, at least in part, a consequence of an excessive focus on measuring performance — something that funders, academic institutions, journals and publishers must all take responsibility for."

and.....

in my case, I would like to highlight the fact that, having ADHD and working in an enviroment where administation sends emails such as this is not a sustainable or diseriable work enviroment. I am by no means deffering from the fact that in this case it is my mistake and responsibility.

I hope you have a great evening.

Regards,
Anthony
