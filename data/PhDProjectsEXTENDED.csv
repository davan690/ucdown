phd20200701013,,Introduction,,,,General literauture points to:,"I guess the most important ""function"" of this chapter is the literature on mesopredator system and how they are modellng (broader than only the NZ case). So here I would start very broad and finish with a description of your case and how it is placed in the literature and where it adds new findings (closes gaps)",,,
phd20200701013,,Introduction,,,,NZ has huge amount of research,,,,
natureMANUSCRIPT,,Introduction,,,,Unexpected outcomes not that uncommon,,,,

phd20200701013,,NZ invasive species database,To collect literature on New Zealand invasive species dynamics and use the hypotheses proposed in the literature to develop a Bayesian modelling framework that incorporates both the proposed ecological processes (e.g. predation) and observation error (e.g. estimating population size) into models of New Zealand invasive species dynamics.,,,"models of abundance, rates or density",generally what do we know in NZ  in relation to resource pressure,,,
phd20200701013,,NZ invasive species database,Invasive species modelling database,,,,not sure what you want to write here (maybe not 100% necessary?),,Paper one: NZ database using AI??,
phd20200701009,,Reproducibility in PFNZ,Reproducing science and why it is important to PFNZ 2050,,,,"also cannot see how this fits, also would park it at the moment if not convinced otherwise",,Paper two: Nature reproducibility comment,
phd20200701007,,Beech forest modelling,"Compare the importance of bottom-up and top-down processes in regulating invasive species in New Zealand forests. I have a case study in a pure beech forest system to model these relationships with data. This will focus on how mouse populations respond to changes in resources, predator abundance and interspecific competition.",,,,,,Beech forest paper,
phd20200701008,,MPD modelling,"Beech/podocarp-hardwood forests are more complex with higher abundances of possums, meaning processes like competition between rodents and possums may influence how populations respond to species removal. I will examine the role of top-down (predator removal) and bottom-up (food availability and competition for food resources) processes in regulating species abundances using a larger, more extensive dataset from podocarp/hardwood forests in the North Island, New Zealand (Chapter Three). ",,,,,,mpd paper,
phd20200701010,,DOC modelling,"Once the key drivers are identified for different forest types, a third, mixed forest dataset from the Tararua Ranges will be used to examine the effects of removing different invasive species on the responses of native species over time.",,,,,,large scale pest control outcomes study,
phd20200701011,,Effects of not accounting for observation and process error correctly,"Overall, this research aims to inform managers of the potential for complex interactions between invasive species to result in unanticipated management outcomes, and to design management approaches to minimise this (Chapter Five).",,,,I would use this chapter for two things. Combine all your findings of chapter 2-4 and based on this derive management recommendations and identify future directions.,,enviro and demo issues paper,
